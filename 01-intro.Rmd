## The center of the distribution {#center}

The center of a distribution of data can be represented by the mean value or the median....


```{r}
x <- rnorm(10)
mean(x)
median(x)
```

## The spread of the distribution {#variance}

The variantion, that is how far _on average_ are the individual observations from the center of the distribution can be represented as the standard deviation or the inter quartile range. 

```{r}
sd(x)
IQR(x)
```
